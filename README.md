# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to view the weather outlook for multiple cities. Users can plan their trips accordingly by checking the current and future weather conditions for various cities. The application utilizes server-side APIs to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the information.


## Overview

This project aims to provide users with a simple and intuitive tool to access weather forecasts for different cities. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, users can search for cities and view detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for both current and future dates.
